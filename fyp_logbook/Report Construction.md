# Experiments
### Static
- All of the various colouring algorithms and the results they produced
- Need tables of iterations and time as density increases

### Dynamic
- Removing edges and nodes to show how the colouring process continues as expected
- Removing a nodes when they are in conflict with a certain proportion of neighbours
- Reduce the number of active agents in the graph (immutable nodes)

### Mobile Agents
- Examples with each of the algorithms and varying numbers of agents
- Iterations, time and percentage increase compared to full agents with varying number of agents and densities
	- Maybe pick three

### Bad Actor
- Demonstration and explanation of bad actor


### Reducing the conflicts in a fixed set
- Initilise the graph with some colouring of a fixed set of colours
- See if the kernel can swap colours with its neighbours in a way that will reduce the number of conflicts in the graph without reducing the number of colours/changing the colours in the graph


# Analysis
- Compare time and results for random, colour blind and minimum
- Consider the results of colour blind algorithms to explain what the wave patterns are doing, how they flatten out and what this tells us
- Compare performance of algorithms with performance using mobile agents with the same conditions


# Left to do
- Make video demo and add links
