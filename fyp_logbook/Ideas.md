#### Specialisations
- Dynamic Graphs
	- Say we have a graph and are half way through colouring when a node disappears/a new node is added/new edges are added
	- How does this affect the colouring
	- Imagine it as a wifi network where people are entering and leaving
		- Can we keep the graph optimised as it changes
	- Recovery time
	- Adding constraints
	- Robustness
	- Applications
		- Spread in social networks
		- Spread of viruses
	- Perculation theory
		- Minimise the number of fluxuations in the graph
	- Measuring constraint violations
		- Have a score for the violations in the graph
		- Maybe you want to update the constraint?
	- Visualising the graph
		- What is the good side of the graph?
- Fully coloured graphs
	- Add a node with a random set of edges
	- How fast can we re-achieve the chromatic number
- Disrupter nodes
	- How does a node which is actively attempting to disrupt the colouring affect the graph
	- When should we settle for a non-complete colouring
- Weighted graphs
	- Similar to the previous
	- How do nodes with weighted influence affect the colouring
	- How can we stop a high influence node which is corrupt from preventing a complete colouring
- Effect of decentralised approaches in the graph colouring domain
	- Mentioned in the [[Research Notes - Graphs#Paper on Decentralised Approaches to Graph Colouring|masters paper]]
	- No research on the effect of decentralised approaches on different graph topologies in the graph colouring domain?
- Weighted Constraints
	- Designing graphs which are robust to constraints


#### Topology
- Regular graphs
- Random graphs


#### Principle of least action
- Some way to apply this to finding the minimum of the curve of solutions?
